# 44691-Module1-Badami4

### Requirements

1. Only a cloud repository will be graded. This repository must hold all requirements.
1. The proposal document written in Markdown. Include clickable links (to your repo, to your hosted page, to your Jira project, etc.).
1. Display sketches of proposed screens (do not assume we will click and download any files - show us!)
1. Provide a list of user roles.
1. Provide a list of prioritized, numbered user stories by role. 
1. Provide an entity-relationship diagram and/or a detailed description of the data you will manage.
1. Provide detailed, useful, sample data in Airtable or Excel - one sheet/tab per entity, all keys must correctly relate.
1. Provide design and interface sketches. Is there a common frame layout you will use for all/most screens? What does the opening page look like on first use? What other screens will appear? 
1. Provide an approximate schedule (we will have three two-week sprints this semester to develop a useful prototype and must complete the functionality and pass all acceptance criteria next semester.)
1. Provide an approximate cost estimate (each developer in GDP should spend 3 hours in class plus an additional 2-3 hours / week outside class, equivalent to about 9-12 hours / week / developer).  
1. Appendix A: Link to the original RFP in electronic form

### Submit

A link to your group public repository with your response to the RFP.
Name one group member who would be willing to help coordinate tasks in Jira.

### Presentation

This is an initial draft. Each group will submit their link before presenting it to the client. Clients will read your materials first. All teams must present to the client within the designated class time.  You will only be able to sell the highlights - do not use more than your allowed time.
